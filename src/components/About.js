                <p>
                    I'm a student who is currently studying database management 
                    and web application at an institution that many may
                    call a 'college'.
                    <br/><br/>
                    I enjoy taking time to solve complex problems by breaking
                    them down into something more small and simple. Although I'm not
                    the best at it, I strive to write elegant and efficient
                    code whether it be HTML, CSS or Javascript.
