                    Something pretty basic that a lot of developers have probably
                    done by now. Made it with OpenWeather API. I made it because
                    I always wanted to but couldn't for some reason. The design
                    isn't original, I took it from somewhere but I forgot. All in all,
                    I'm glad I made it.
