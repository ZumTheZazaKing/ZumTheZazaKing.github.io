                It's just like QTPI Online but for Discord! QTPI Discord is 
                a Discord bot I made when I curious about making a Dicord bot. 
                With the commands, it can perform moderation such as kick a member, 
                mute a member and ban a member. The bot also provides entertainment 
                with a fun little fishing game where you can reel in fish and make 
                money to buy stuff from the shop.
