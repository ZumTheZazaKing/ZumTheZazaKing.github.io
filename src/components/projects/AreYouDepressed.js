                A web app where you can measure your mental health using DASS-21. 
                This project was made for exclusively for an innovation competition. 
                All you have to do is agree to take the test, answer some questions
                and get your results. This web app serves a purpose <i>(kinda)</i> and 
                I'm kinda proud of it.
